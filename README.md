# Tower of Hanoi Solver 🏗️  

## 📌 Introduction  
This repository contains a simple yet efficient solution to the **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle, implemented using recursion. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical problem that involves moving a set of disks from one rod to another while following specific rules.  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ Recursive approach for solving the puzzle.  
✅ Customizable input for different numbers of disks.  
✅ Step-by-step solution displayed as text output.  
✅ (Optional) Visualization for better understanding.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1️⃣ Clone this repository:  


   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tower-of-hanoi.git  

2️⃣ Navigate to the project directory:
cd tower-of-hanoi  

3️⃣ Run the script (if using Python):
python hanoi.py  

4️⃣ Enter the number of disks when prompted and watch the solution unfold!

📜 Rules of the Puzzle
🔹 Only one disk can be moved at a time.
🔹 A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk.
🔹 Disks can only be moved from the top of a stack.

📌 Example Output (For 3 Disks)
Move disk 1 from A to C  
Move disk 2 from A to B  
Move disk 1 from C to B  
Move disk 3 from A to C  
Move disk 1 from B to A  
Move disk 2 from B to C  
Move disk 1 from A to C  

🚧 Future Enhancements
✨ GUI-based visualization.
✨ Iterative (non-recursive) approach.
✨ Implementations in other languages.
